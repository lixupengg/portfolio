		bookTitle: `Anything You Want \n 40 Lessons for a new kind of Entrepreneur`,
		bookAuthor: 'Derek Sivers',
		bookTakeaways: [
			`> You should feel pain when you're unclear: One unclear sentence 
            in an email will result in many confused replies, but unclear phrasings 
            in a website don't have that feedback. Find a way to measure that!`,
			`> Little details matter; Although its tempting to focus on the big thoughts, 
            small things such as one goofy email can go a long way.`,
			`> There's a benefit to being naive about the norms of the world: you can 
            decide from scratch what seems like the right thing to do.`

		bookPhoto: LeanStartup,
		bookTitle: 'The Lean Startup',
		bookAuthor: 'Eric Ries',
		bookTakeaways: [
			`> Value hypothesis - to test whether a product really delivers value to customers once they are using it.`,
			`> Value hypothesis relevant metrics could be if users come back to the site every day`,
			`> Growth hypothesis - to test how new customers will discover your product.`,
			`> Growth hypothesis relevant metrics could be simply organic growth etc`,
			`> Lifecycle of a start-up should be to build-measure-learn and repeat`,
			`> Concierge MVP - ensure participants have an experience as good as can be.`,
			`> Choose features based on customer complaints.`,
			`> The goal of a startup's early efforts (MVP) is to test assumptions as quickly as possible.`

	{
		bookPhoto: Jabjabjab,
		bookTitle: 'Jab Jab Jab Right Hook',
		bookAuthor: 'Gary Vaynerchuk',
		bookTakeaways: [
			`> Big brands often insist on having a consistent tone across different platforms,
			but that's a mistake, different platforms have different cultures and norms and should be taken
			advantaged of.`,
			'> Each social platform is unique & requires a different formula.',
			'> Content is king, but context is God.',
			`> Three most popular apps: social networks (people are interested in people), 
			entertainment (people want to escape), utility (people value service) 
			-- your content should be one of these.`,
			'> Not every piece of content should be a sell, some should be giving value for free to build trust.'

		bookPhoto: TwelveRules,
		bookTitle: '12 Rules For Life - An antidote to chaos',
		bookAuthor: 'Jordan B. Peterson',
		bookTakeaways: [
			`> There is no winning - without group-centred beliefs (religion, ideologies), life is
			rendered chaotic, but with group-centred beliefs, conflict with other groups are inevitable.`,
			`> Objective experiences are experienced subjectively.`,
			`> Perceptions do not perceive objective reality first, then inferred intent and purpose. 
			It's often the other way round - ie we perceive things as tools before we perceive things as objects.`,
			`> Author's stance on why we often treat other people better than ourselves, is because human nature
			causes us to see ourself with a dim view of ourselves, knowing the full range of our secret
			transgressions, insufficiencies and inadequacies, but only you know this. (sounds like the cliche
			love yourself tbh)`,
			`> Dogs are predators, they kill things and eat them, but we still take care of them and love them - 
			because we believe it's just their nature. We should do the same for ourselves with our own
			mortality. (feel like this could be argued against.. hmm..)`,
			`> Just keep asking three questions: 'What is bothering me?', 'Can I fix it?', 'Am i willing to fix it?',
			if the answer is no, then aim lower and search for a smaller problem, and fix that.`,
			`> Our ancestors acted out a drama: they personified fate as a spirit that can be bargained with, as if
			it was another human being, and the amazing thing is that it worked. - probably because the future is
			largely composed of other human beings.`,
			`> We cannot invent our own values, because we cannot merely impose what we believe on our souls.`,
			`> The author soon realized that everything he said subconsciously had motives - he wanted to win arguments,
			gain status, and impress people and get what he wanted. (fixing this is tiring, also is this necessarily 
			bad? Don't we say things to portray ourselves as who we want to be? mmm..)`,
			`> Don't have life-lies. (eg many people adopt a single axiom, eg 'Government is bad', and filter their
			experiences and insist everything can be explained by that axiom)`,
			`> Rationality is subject to the single worst temptation - to raise what it knows now to the status 
			of an absolute.`,
			`> Communism was attractive not so much to oppressed workers nor its hypothetical beneficiaries, but 
			to intellectuals whom pride assured them that they were always right. (LOL)`,
			`> Assume that the person you are listening to might know something you don't.`,
			`> Girls do better in school than boys. Boys interest tilt towards things; girls tilt towards people. 
			(It was backed by research apparently but I'm laze to cite)`,
			`> Any hierarchy creates winners and losers, but it's a necessary evil. Because: hierarchies are formed 
			through the collective pursuit of any valued goal (as some will be better and some worse at that pursuit), 
			and it is the pursuit of goals that in large part lends life its sustaining meaning.`,
			`> Gender is a social construct, but an individual who desires gender re-assignment surgery is unarguable 
			considered a man trapped in a woman's body. These two statements,
			however, cannot be both simultaneously logically true. (fair).`,
			`> People favor their own groups. Experiments were made where they just flipped a coin and assigned people 
			to groups, and people still favoured the co-members of their groups.`,
			`> When shit happens in life (eg losing a loved one), thinking about how unbearable life is is logical, 
			hating life is logical, but going down that rabbit hole would result
			in decisions like suicide or even genocide (in extreme cases). But the author argues that hating life 
			will only make life worse, thus the author concludes that sometimes thinking is not the answer, 
			but 'noticing', noticing that when you love someone, its not despite their limitations, rather 
			its because of their limitations. (See next point for elaboration on noticing)`,
			`> Pay attention even on a bad day, and you might be confronted with small opportunities (eg a 
			particularly good cup of coffee etc).`,
			`> You need to choose whether you want to be right, or whether you want peace. (LOL x2)`
